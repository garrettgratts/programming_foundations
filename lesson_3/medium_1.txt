Question 1

10.times { |number| puts (" " * number) + "The Flintstones Rock!" }

Question 2

The error comes from attemping to concanenate a string with an integer
"the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
"the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

Question 3

until divisor == 0
  factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
  divisor -= 1
end

Bonus 1: For a number to be a factor, it cannot create a remainder
Bonus 2: The method won't return the array of factors. Loops return nil by default. 

Question 4

rolling_buffer1 will mutate the array passed in, and return a new one
rolling_buffer2 will only return a new array

Question 5

Method definitions are self contained with respect to local variables.
Just pass it in with a parameter.
